				},
				"answer":{
					"type":"text"
				},

{
	"question":"Relational Algebra, Query Processing (Slides)，Hi Prof,As hi lighted in red if joint is not implemented via product, r joins s has been noted as below? ",
	"answer":"I did not get your question.This slide says that (Natural) Join can be expressed using other RA operators (Cartesian Product,Selection, and Projection). Furthermore, since in general the number of tuples of a Join operation is much less than the number of tuples of a Product operation, Join is then not implemented using Product since the performance would be degraded.",
	"source":"forum"
}

{
    "_index": "course",
    "_type": "QAset",
    "_id": "RLV1dGkBAQ3LnVVVJNNe",
    "_version": 1,
