Database,A collection of related data. Database can be manipulated by a database management system.
Database management system (DBMS),A collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database.
Database Administrator (DBA),"Responsible for authorizing access to the database, coordinating and monitoring its use, acquiring software and hardware resources, controlling its use and monitoring efficiency of operations"
Database Designer,"Responsible for defining the structure, the constraints, and transactions. Must communicate with the end-users and understand their needs"
End Users,"Casual, Naïve, Sophisticated and Stand-alone"
Data modelling,A design process converts requirements into data model with two kinds logical and physical.
Quality of Designs,"Correctness, completeness and consistency."
Entity-Relationship (ER) Model,"Consist of attribute, entity and relationship."
ER diagram,"An ER diagram consists of a collection of entity set, relationship set, attributes and connection s between entity and relationship sets."
Superkey,Any set of attributes whose set of values are distinct over entity set and natural or atificial.
Candidate key,Any superkey such that no proper subset of its attirbutes is also a superkey.
Primary key,It is one candidate key chosen by the database designer.
Relationship,An association among several entities
Relationship set,Collection of relationships of the same type
Degree,Number of entites invove in relationship.
Cardinality,Number of associated entities on each side of relationship
Weak entities,exist only because of association with strong entities have no key of their own; have a discriminator
Relational database schema,It is a set of relation schemas and a set of integrity constraints.
Relational database instance,a set of relation instances where all of the integrity constraints are satisfied
Mapping Composite Attributes,Composite attributes are mapped by concatenation or flattening.
Mapping Multi-valued Attributes (MVAs),MVAs are mapped by a new table linking values to their entity.
relational database management system (RDBMS),"RDBMS is software designed to support large-scale data-intensive applications allowing high-level description of data (tables, constraints) with high-level access to the data (relational model, SQL) providing efficient storage and retrieval (disk/memory management) supporting multiple simultaneous users (privilege, protection) doing multiple simultaneous operations (transactions, concurrency) )
