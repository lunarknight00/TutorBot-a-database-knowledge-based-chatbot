forum," Hi Rachid, When I tried to log in CSE using VNC by following the instructions below: http://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/VNC/ I got the desktop like below: which is not the desktop that I got from the lab. What is this desktop and how can I get the desktop that I get from the lab? thank you!

For a Mac ... download and install a VPN client like AnyConnect download and install a VNC client like TigerVNC run the VPN client using zID,zPass to set up a connection to UNSW run the VNC client using vlab.cse.unsw.edu.au:5919 as your VNC server To find the clients, just use a Google search on the name. They comes as packages and are easy to install (on a Mac at least). Gives me a desktop that looks like a CSE workstation. I presume similar clients exist for (ugh) Windows.", Follow the instructions in the following link instead: https://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/VLAB_-_The_technical_details/ I am using Windows with TigerVNC Viewer and Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client clients for resp. VNC and VPN clients and it works fine.
forum," Hello Sir, COMP9311 is not available on Moodle, I assume we will use only WebCMS3? Will lecture recordings be available here as well? Thanks, Shoaib Hi Rachid, Do you have a link to lecture recordings? Hi Rachid, I can see that, but I understand the actual lectures themselves will be recorded for students in the Web Stream - is that correct? If so, I can't find a link to the lecture recordings."," Hello Shoaib, I just made Moodle shell for the course visible for students.  However, I put a note saying that COMP9311 Moodle shell is NOT the main COMP9311 course website.   We will be using WebCMS3 instead. This Moodle shell will be simply used to provide access to some videos very related to the content of the course.  I will also put these videos available on WebCMS3 under Lectures. Rachid Hello William, I just posted under Lectures three videos related to ER Design (the important topic discussed in the class today). Hello William, The link has been added under Lectures.  However, the lecture recordings aren't yet available.  This will be hopefully sorted out soon."

forum," Hi professor, I am confused about total participation when we are drawing the ER diagram. Because sometimes the question didn’t directly show that an entity is total participation in the relationship, so we may need to understand the meaning and infer that it is total or partial participation. However, although sometimes our inference is reasonable, the answer may differ from ours. So, my question is that do we only need to add total participation between two entities according to the questions? Thank you! Thank you professor, I will make reasonable assumptions during the exam."," Furthermore, since assumptions may differ from one student to another, there will be no ONE unique answer for the question and this is perfectly fine."
forum," Hello Dr Hamadi, I was wondering about Q2(b) relational database schema in which the answer separated ""Play"" from ""Game"". As far as I have learnt, we are supposed to merge n-to-1 relations into ""n"", and therefore, ""Game"" is supposed to be merged into ""Play"", like this: Relation PlayGame: GID | HomeTeam | ForeignTeam | homeRebounds | ......ForeignSteals (PK----FK--------------                FK---------------                   attributes-------------------------------------  ) Is this correct?

I know the result is much less than product, which could be the result of the later select after the product. All I want to know is the actually implementation of join get the product first?(as you indicated above is not?) in that case the RA product expression is just a representation of join but have nothing to do with the actual implementation? Thankyou Erik"," I did not get your question. This slide says that (Natural) Join can be expressed using other RA operators (Cartesian Product, Selection, and Projection).  Furthermore, since in general the number of tuples of a Join operation is much less than the number of tuples of a Product operation, Join is then not implemented using Product since the performance would be degraded.

forum," Another question... definition of devision 1.r / s = r Div s = { t | t ∈ r[R-S] ∧ satisfy } 2.where satisfy = ∀ ts ∈ S ( &exists; tr ∈ R ( tr [S] = ts ∧ tr [R-S] = t ) ) since we are performing the attributes difference opeartion: t ∈ r[R-S] do we have to make sure that the common attributes have the same name in this case column B? if not should we rename the attribute to make them the same like join? Also, do we need to understand the logic representation? since the line 1. says there should be such tuple t that satisfy t ∈ r[R-S] and satisfy and then in line 2. when we define the condition satisfy there is a condition  tr [R-S] = t where we refer back to t is that recursive? we use a to be defined tuple as condition to define this to be defined tuple?

There is no recursivity in the definition.  For readability reasons we wrote ""satisfy"" in another line.  We could have written the whole condition as follows: r / s = r Div s = { t | t ∈ r[R-S] ∧ (∀ ts ∈ S ( ∃ tr ∈ R ( tr [S] = ts ∧ tr [R-S] = t ) ) )  } Try to understand the explanation given in plain English: (1) consider each subset of tuples in R that match on t[R-S] (meaning consider only the attributes of R-S), (2) for this subset of tuples, take the t[S] (meaning consider only the attributes of S) values from each, and (3) if this covers all tuples in S, then include t[R-S] in the result.

forum," Dear Dr. Rachid Hamadi, (For the slide 'Normal Forms (cont)') This is the reference that I read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form It says non-prime attribute instead of non-key attribute, and the definition of non-prime attribute is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key of the relation. I also read the original paper , but it just introduces a simple case which has only one candidate key, which is a primary key as well, in the table. However, the wikipedia document above gives us the example when it violates the rule of 2NF for a non-primary candidate key. (I cannot use Wiki as a reference, but the example makes sense.) Best Regards, Curt Thanks very much for your answer."," Thanks Curt for this important post. As I told you after the lecture, there are two definitions for 2NF and 3NF. The first one is based on primary keys as first proposed by Codd in 1972.  This is useful where primary keys have already been defined.  This definition does not take other candidate keys of a relation, if any, into account.  Section 15.3 (Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys) of Elmasri and Navathe textbook (Fundamentals of Database Systems, Elmasri and Navathe, 6th edition, 2011, Addison-Wesley) discusses that.  Please do read it. The second definition is more general in the sense that it takes ALL candidate keys of a relation, if any, into account.  Section 15.4 (General Definitions of Second and Third Normal Forms) of Elmasri and Navathe textbook (Fundamentals of Database Systems, Elmasri and Navathe, 6th edition, 2011, Addison-Wesley) discusses that.  Please do read it as well. Please note that the above do not apply to the definition of 1NF since it is independant of keys and functional dependencies."

forum," Hi Prof, What exactly is the difference between CREATE TYPE and CREATE DOMAIN, looks like they are doing the similar thing to define data type .... not sure if  CREATE TYPE is the similar spirit in C such as: typedef int number; number foo; There is not much mentioning the difference in the lecture. Thank you! Erik Thank you Prof ! I see ,so CREATE DOMAIN is a constrain instance of an existing data type whereas CREATE TYPE will define new data type."," CREATE TYPE is used to define a new data type whereas CREATE DOMAIN is used to define a new domain of an existing type.

However, since the participation is total from the course side this means ALL courses should appear in this relationship.  Hence, each course must have one staff meaning convenor should be ""not null"".  On the other hand, we may have a staff who does not teach any course because of the partial participation.  Hope this is clear."
forum," Hi, I was looking at this weeks lecture slides and the solution for the provided SQL solution. I executed the SQL script on a database I created, and for practise I wanted to try and insert data and play around with the database. I then noticed after receiving some errors and reviewing the provided solution, that there is a circular reference existing in the tables, for example, between the Employee and Department tables due to the foreign keys each referring to each other. Because of this you can't insert a record for a Department, because there is no manager (Employee) set with whichever value you provide. Similarly, you can't create an Employee record because there are no departments to assign. I do have some past experience in SQL, but I'm not so familiar with this kind of structure, I always have avoided it. I wasn't sure how to proceed so I looked up the best way to insert data with this kind of structure. I then found a lot of debate in which people were saying that creating circular dependencies was bad practise. I haven't yet figured out how to insert data into this table, I have read that we would need to alter the restraints so that they are deferrable. Or alternatively remove the constraints, insert data and then add the constraints back again. Can someone explain what the best thing to do in this situation is? Cheers, Jamie. Okay Thanks Rachid! I'll make sure I check it out. Sorry for jumping the gun :)"," Jamie, this is exactly what you are going to do in Lab 2 Exercise 10.  Please do go through it.

forum," Hello Rashid, Do you recommend any good ER designer tool suitable to this particular dialect of ERD? Thank you. This was what I was planning to use, but it's missing overlap/disjoint gates, and both carnality and participation are denoted differently too. Is it ok to use it for our purposes? This sounds easy enough, thank you."," https://erdplus.com/#/standalone ) is the closest ERD tool, to the notation we are using in class, I could find.  You can save as a .erdplus or export as a PNG file. I do prefer that you stick to the notation that we are using in this class.  However, if you know how to translate the cardinality and participation used in our class notation to the ones used by this tool then it should be fine.  Another way to generate something similar to our class notation is to use this convenient tool to draw the ER diagram without cardinality and participation then export it as a png file.  Finally, edit the png file with a graphical software and add the ""one"" cardinalities (that is, the missing arrows) and the ""total"" participations (making them thick)."

forum," Hello Dr Hamadi, Thank you for your lecture. I was not quite clear about slides #41 and 42. What is the difference between a total relationship and one-to-one cardinality? Do they represent the same thing? Thank you. Feng Thank you sir. This is perfectly clear."," Actually, I did not go through the last slides (from slide 40) in our first lecture since class time was over. I will start my week 2 lecture by going through the rest of slides not covered in week 1 lecture. Total (relationship) participation and one-to-one (relationship) cardinality are NOT the same. In slide #41, the cardinality between Customer and Loan entities is many-to-many meaning a Customer can have zero or more Loans and a Loan can be taken by zero or more Customers. Partial participation (indicated by a normal line) means not all Customers are participating in the relationship TakesOut. Total participation (indicated by a thick line or double line) means ALL Loans are participating in the relationship TakesOut. In other words, for Total participation, every Loan must have a Customer associated to it via TakesOut relationship. One-to-one cardinality in slide #42 (between Manager and Branch entities) means a Manager manages at most one Branch and a Branch is managed by at most one Manager. Why I am using ""at most"" since both participations are partial. If, for instance, between ""Manages"" and ""Branch"" the directed line was thick (or double) then the meaning will be ""a Branch is managed by exactly ONE Manager"". Hope this is clear. Anyway, I will be discussing it in our next lecture as I said."

forum," Hi Professor, As we know BCNF may produce redundancy, and if we choose different order the result may be different. Here is an example R = SBD fds = { SB --> D, D -->B } If I deal with D à B firstly, obviously D à B satisfies BCNF. Then R1 = SD, fds1 = {S à D} Obviously Sà D satisfies BCNF So the result could be (D,B) (S,D) Another way R = SBD fds = { SB --> D, D -->B } SB à D satisfies D (SB is the candidate key) Then R1 = SB fds1 = {} (Trivially ) So SB satisfies BCNF So the result could be (SB,S) (S,B) Which is right? As I know strategy_1 ignore the composition of SB, strategy_2 produce the redundancy. Thank you !"," The way you write and explain is not fully correct, for instance, instead of ""satisfy"" you should say ""violate"". First the keys are SD (since SD+ = SDB) and SB (since SB+=SBD) If you start with D-->B, the result will be SD and DB If you start with SB-->D, this FD does not violate BCNF since SB is a key.  Meaning you will go and check the other FD which is D-->B which will take you to the above case, that is, SD and DB."

forum," Hi, is there a good reason why postgre does not automatically enforce that the data types of foreign key and the primary key it references match?

However, PostgreSQL and other SQL implementations are not strict on that since they allow compatible types such as one being text and the other being varchar(1) as you mentioned.

Actually if you look at the answer carefully, (SPJTriples Div AllJobNums) gives a table with supplier and part attributes (see definition of Division operation).  Then, we do projection of the result on supplier (i.e., Proj[supplier](SPJTriples Div AllJobNums)) which give a result with supplier attribute only.  Review Division operation in slides 35-38. 2. No. It returns (sidA,sidB) tuples. AllPairs is a table of (sidA,sidB) pairs.  Then we apply a Selection operation on it (last line).  Since selection is reducing the number of rows and does not modify the number of columns (which is the role of Projection operation) there will be then no change in terms of the type of tuples to be output which is (sidA,sidB).  The note after the solution explains what the Selection operation does: ""It takes pairs of supplier numbers (sidA,sidB), finds the set of parts supplied by each, and then checks that these sets are equal.

However, overall, you need to know what these catalogs are used for. 3. Slide 29 gives a lot of examples.

forum," Hi professor. Is there possibility to upload past exams? I am reading a book and there is a lot of information, so I want to know what exactly I should pay attention to. Do slides cover whole material which can be on the exam?"," Yes.  Isn't it a bit early to do that? I will definitely do that sometime in Week 11 or week 12. You will be examined on the topics we will be covering in the lectures and labs.  We will not ask you questions about topics that are in the textbooks that we did (will) not cover.  Hence, while referring to the textbooks read only the parts we covered in lectures and labs.  Having said that, it is always good to read other related topics for your own benefit and knowledge building."
