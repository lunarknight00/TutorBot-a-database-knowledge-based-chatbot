Week 1
	I made a group with three other classmates in the laboraty. Then we ask couples questions about two topics for understanding the requests of each one. After comparitions, we deicde to choose topic 1 for our team. We also try to search the tools for the project.
	Besides, we did some plan for next several weeks such as writing proposal.
Week2 
This week we meet on the lab and discussed the proposal and the key feature of our project. After some comparations, we decide to build a robot for the student-tutor chat robot since there are exiting resource for our project. Besides, we continued the discussion last week which about the chosen of database, different situation in the conversation, the problem of the number of questions in database, what function we need to accomplish and row design for the robot. According to the answer from tutor, we decided the basic design and assigned the task to everyone in the team for writing proposal.
Trying to finish my part and combine with others.

Week3
This week we meet before lab for finishing the proposal and discuss the problems so far. The design of the project has been decided and written into the proposal. We discussed some functions from the feasibility and complexity, then change some points in the architecture and proposal. We also thought about the possibility of the extra features which would be different with other teams. So, we add some more epics to the proposal for partial implementation and try to build a basic interface for testing the design. 
Still working on the project and try to use some skills of agile programming in it. But all of us agree to build the basic model for our robot, then try to make the software to be agile.

Week4
This week we finish the basic data extracter and partially compelete knowledge base which uses the source from the UNSW handbook for course infromation and the texts from the stackoverflow for some specific questions such as python.

We decide to use elastive search for data searching and extracting. The data would be transfer from our knowledge base to the elastive search's database for using in conversations. However, the algorithm is too simple so far, we plan to biuld more effiency method for data extract. The current idea is trying to use several key words on the course handbook and prepare some words with similer meaning for handling the different way of question from the user. 

Besides, we have accomplished some very basic design of our user interface.

Week5
This week I am still working on the training of our robot for general conversation and try to make a version for the web app.
The robot has been able to answer some basic questions, but it still need more intends for daily conversations. Base on our desgin, we would let the dialogflow robot to do this job.
From the dialogflow, I think we could use that to build our own talking section and conbine with other part such as es and crawel program.
