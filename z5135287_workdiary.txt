Week 1

  We formed a group and created github and Trello project with the help of tutor. During the lab, we discussed two topics with respect to the guidelines and specs. In terms of our discussion, we decided to choose topic one. 
  
Week 2

  we had a profound discussion in this week via identifying the issues we had and each team member prepare to give their thoughts and ideas.
  With a in-depth discussion of ongoing proposal draft, we reached an agreement that we would build a tutor chatbot based on the information retrieved from handbook UNSW. By doing research on familiar projects been done and published articles, We tackled several key issues wile develop this chatbot.
  1. where to find the database of courses?
  2. what Q & A that the chatbot would compiled?
  3. What the key functions we would like to represent?
  4. How would we distinguish ourselves from other teams' work?
  5. Which kinds of databases and tecnical stack we would like to apply in this project?
  6. What is the arcitecture of the chatbot we would build?
  In order to sovle these issues, we create checklists for tasks to be done within upcoming 2 weeks on Trello. In the maeantime, we assigned tasks to each team member to draft a proposal with a deadline.

Week  3

A productive week, we drafted our proposal days before the deadline and determined technical stack.

We had a addtional meeting for some unclear parts in our projects. We made some decisions to the key parts and done drafting proposal. In terms of some advice from tutor, we made modifications to some parts of the proposal.

- We changed our aim from multiple courses to one single coure.
- Within the domain of the course, we are subject to provide sophiscated response to the users ranged from course content related questions, coding issues and so on.  
- There are modifications in data sources from unary UNSW handbook to multiple data sources. For now, we decide to add Stackoverflow and course forum.
- Create a server set to deploy api and bacdend. 
- In addition, we settled our Python boosted tecnical stack.

To the next week, we plan to develop a database for the chatbot.

Week 4

We had a  good start of the code this week. Several things has been done.
- ElasticSearch booseted backend has been built up on Google cloud.
- On the half way to data extraction, due to the data sources.
- Frontend demo has been developed roughly.

In addition, we modified feew parts in our develpment with the help of tutuor.
- Change the frontend to a easy to use, simple website.
- Extensibly frictionless, which can apply to a personal assistant like Amazon Alexa.

- Add aluxilary assisitant such as Google Diagflow into the chatbot, in terms of the case user may ask random question with an informative anwser.
- Reassigned task to a teammate.

Few tasks planned for upcoming weeks.
- Data extraction with designed forms of data.
- Further development of Frontend.
