WEEK 1
In the first week of the lab discussion, we decided to do project 1.
To complete a chat bot, we have to achieve the following three basic points.
1. A knowledge extraction/building module.
2. A dialog builder.
3. An Application/UI component.
Accroding to our proj1.pdf, we have three choices:
1. A household company assistant
2. A student-tutor support system
3. A household butler
We are still discussing about which type to choose.
